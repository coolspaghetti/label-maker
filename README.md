## Label Maker

This is a little tool I made to create custom labels for my magazine/magazine clippings collection!

It uses data from a CSV file (Magazine, Edition, Year) and generates an A4 sheet with labels.
The tool recognizes already printed rows through hashing and doesn't add them to the sheet again.
